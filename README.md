## Results

From the data extracted we could gather many important information. When studying the customer behavior and trends, we could realize that during this period the majority of users that had longer rides are in the range 50 years old. Also, less then 500,000 users are not subscribers what can be a great opportunity to captivate customers who are already subscribers and gather data about them.

As the time using this service is a big determinant for investors, a good way to approach viability would be considering the gender target and how direction campaigns on the future. In the image below you can see that once again the Male gender is predominant on duration of bike rides once they also represent a large part of the data. Representing more then 70% of total users. Also, a trend on bike rides on the period average of 30 minutes.

We have weekday finds such as starting and ending times, between 6:00AM to 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM would be the busiest times. Using this base and comparing to the application of service, a deeper study on availability on the most used areas during these times would considerably improve the quality of service.

When applying this analysis finds to future opportunities it is recommended that the marketing tools are focus on Males, since they represent a reliable market, probably explore the hour availability for commute and encourage subscribers to fidelity plans studying their data through time.If viable research oppotunities of market on Female users.
